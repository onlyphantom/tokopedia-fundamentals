    "# Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Statisticians and data scientists use descriptive statistics to summarize and describe a large number of measurements. Many times, this task is accompanied with graphs and plots that help describe the numerical summary of data. When data science is applied in the business context, an example of descriptive statistic is the average number of transactions per month. Another example is the percentage of e-commerce transactions with a voucher code applied. The simple rule is that descriptive statistics do not involve generalizing beyond the data we have obtained, and are merely descriptive of what we have at hand. The branch of statistics that deal with drawing inferences about the larger population is called inferential statistics.\n",

    "In describing data, we are typically concerned with the task of quantifying and comparing central tendency, variability, and the shape of our data. In this coursebook, we'll be working on with Tokopedia listing item in handphones section:"
