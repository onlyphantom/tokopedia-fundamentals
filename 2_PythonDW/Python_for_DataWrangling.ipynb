    "## Indexing and Subsetting with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Using indexing operators to select, summarize or transform only a subset of data is a critical part of any data analysis workflow. Consider the following use-cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the sales in Year 2018 vs Year 2019  \n",
    "- Identify missed opportunities in a specific market segment\n",
    "- Best quarter of the year to execute cross-selling promos / discounts\n",
    "- Study profitability of goods in the higher price range (e.g. IDR45000000+) and how competitors positioning affect sales in that price range\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in all of these use-cases, data analysts will want to use some combination of indexing and then perform the necessary computations on that specific slice or slices of data. Unsurprisingly, `pandas` come with a number of methods to help you accomplish this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, we'll take a closer look at some of the most common slicing and subsetting operations in `pandas`:\n",
    "- `head()` and `tail()`  \n",
    "- `select_dtypes()`  \n",
    "- Using `.drop()` \n",
    "- The `[]` operator\n",
    "- `.loc`  \n",
    "- `.iloc`\n",
    "- Conditional subsetting"

   "source": [
    "Say we're only really interested in the numeric columns of our data, we can use `select_dtypes` to selectively include or exclude only particular data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, I use `select_dtypes` to _include_ only textual columns (`objects`) and then proceed to pass the output of this function call into `.head()`. Notice that when we chain two methods this way, the output of the first function call will be \"passed\" into the second function call: "
